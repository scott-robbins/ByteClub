Can I provide code that generates more code, and does something opaque to user?

# Experiment - Yes, I know this is a bad idea

This is a silly idea, and no *good* software should do this. But this is for 
fun, and this is *not good software*. Have fun with it if you want.


# Why are you doing this? 

I'm not that bright. People do this kind of thing all the time making terrible
software and I'm curious how one would go about doing it. It's not like I'm 
going to use this as a programming or design philosophy elsewhere. I just want
to try something that sounds like a weird challenge. 

# Give it a Try! (It's just silly not malicious)
```
git clone https://github.com/0ptik41/Experiment
cd Experiment/BlackBoxy
python main.py -run
```
